;;; Commentary:

;; * Description
;;
;; Emacs's native auto-save feature simply
;; sucks. auto-save-buffers-enhanced.el provides such and other more
;; useful features which only require a few configurations to set up.
;;
;; auto-save-buffers-enhanced.el borrows main ideas and some codes
;; written by Satoru Takabayashi and enhances the original one. Thanks
;; a lot!!!
;;
;; See http://0xcc.net/misc/auto-save/
;;
;; * Usage
;;
;; Just simply put the code below into your .emacs:
;;
;;   (require 'auto-save-buffers-enhanced)
;;   (auto-save-buffers-enhanced t)
;;
;; You can explicitly set what kind of files should or should not be
;; auto-saved. Pass a list of regexps like below:
;;
;;   (setq auto-save-buffers-enhanced-include-regexps '(".+"))
;;   (setq auto-save-buffers-enhanced-exclude-regexps '("^not-save-file" "\\.ignore$"))
;;
;; If you want `auto-save-buffers-enhanced' to work only with the files under
;; the directories checked out from VCS such as CVS, Subversion, and
;; svk, put the code below into your .emacs:
;;
;;   ;; If you're using CVS or Subversion or git
;;   (require 'auto-save-buffers-enhanced)
;;   (auto-save-buffers-enhanced-include-only-checkout-path t)
;;   (auto-save-buffers-enhanced t)
;;
;;   ;; If you're using also svk
;;   (require 'auto-save-buffers-enhanced)
;;   (setq auto-save-buffers-enhanced-use-svk-flag t)
;;   (auto-save-buffers-enhanced-include-only-checkout-path t)
;;   (auto-save-buffers-enhanced t)
;;
;; You can toggle `auto-save-buffers-enhanced' activity to execute
;; `auto-save-buffers-enhanced-toggle-activity'. For convinience, you
;; might want to set keyboard shortcut of the command like below:
;;
;;   (global-set-key "\C-xas" 'auto-save-buffers-enhanced-toggle-activity)
;;
;; Make sure that you must reload the SVK checkout paths from your
;; configuration file such as `~/.svk/config', in which SVK stores the
;; information on checkout paths, by executing
;; `auto-save-buffers-reload-svk' after you check new files out from
;; your local repository. You can set a keyboard shortcut for it like
;; below:
;;
;;   (global-set-key "\C-xar" 'auto-save-buffers-enhanced-reload-svk)
;;
;; For more details about customizing, see the section below:
;;

;;; Change Log:

;; 2011-08-01:
;;  * added a feature; auto-save *scratch* buffer into file.
;;
;; 2008-03-14:
;;  * fixed a typo: s/activitiy/avtivity/
;;
;; 2008-02-22:
;;  * fixed a bug: auto-saving didn't work under unreasonable situation...
;;    (Thanks to typester)
;;
;; 2008-02-19:
;;  * added git support.
;;  * fixed a bug: this package didn't work with SVN and CVS if
;;    use-svk-flag is non-nil.
;;
;; 2007-12-10:
;;  * added a command, `auto-save-buffers-enhanced-reload-svk'.
;;    (Thanks to typester: http://unknownplace.org/memo/2007/12/10#e001)
